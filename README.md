Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. 
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Oftentimes, the challenge in solved a Project Euler problem is not just obtaining the correct answer, but optimizing for speed and time/space complexity.
